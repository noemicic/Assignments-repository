      Basic operations. Based on topology, content and hybrid.  
      Graph query languages: GraphQL.  
      Graph database concept: tool heterogeneity when implementing the graph structures. Impact of such decisions in the main operations.  
      Distributed graph databases. Need and difficulties. Thinking like a vertex paradigm as standard de facto in distributed graph processing.  
      Main distributed graph algorithms.  
   - Knowledge graph management  
      Data structure. RDF. Origin and relationship with Linked Open Data. Integrity constraints.  
      Data structure: RDFS and OWL. Relationship with first order logic. Foundations in Description Logics. Integrity constraints. Reasoning.  
      Basic operations and query language. SPARQL and underlying algebra. Entailment regimes (reasoning).   
      Triplestores. Differences with graph databases. Native implementations. Implementations based on the relational data model. Impact of such decisions on the basic operations.  
      Distributed triplestore. Needs and difficulties. Graph Engine 1.0 as paradigm of distributed triplestore.  
      Main distributed algorithms.  
      Graph embeddings.  
   - Graphs as solution to the Variety challenge  
      Graphs as the best canonical model for data integration.  
      Graph data models main features. Differences with other data models (specially the relational data model).  
      Data and metadata concepts and their formalization in graph models.  
      Use cases (highlighting topological benefits): fraud detection, bioinformatics, traffic and logistics, social networks, etc.  
      Introduction to the main graph models: property graph and knowledge graphs.
